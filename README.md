# Final-Project---Driving-School
As part of the project, we were required to create a database for a driving school. We were asked to formulate business questions to understand the school's goals and to write queries for analyzing the collected data. The aim was to develop a system that provides valuable insights, improves service quality, and enables data-driven decision-making.
